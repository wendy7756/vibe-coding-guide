## Detailed Development Process

### Step 1: Project Planning and Design

**Requirements Analysis Conversation Example:**
```
I want to create a travel guide website with the following features:
- Homepage showcasing featured destinations

- Markdown content management (as simple as editing Notion)
- Tailwind CSS responsive design
- Vercel one-click deployment

### Step 2: Tech Stack Selection and Configuration

**Global Travel Guide Tech Stack:**
```bash
# Direct conversation in Cursor
Please help me create an Astro project including:
- Homepage template
- City detail page template
- Navigation component
- Responsive layout
- Tailwind CSS configuration
```

**FollowNet Tech Stack:**
```bash
# More complex full-stack project
Please help me set up a Next.js project needing:
- Frontend user interface
- Python backend API
- Data scraping functionality
- User authentication system
- Deployment configuration
```

### Step 3: Detailed Development Process

**1. Frontend Development**
Advantages of using Cursor:
- **Component Generation**: Describe requirements, AI directly generates React/Astro components
- **Style Debugging**: Real-time preview, write and see effects simultaneously
- **Responsive Adaptation**: AI automatically handles mobile adaptation

```javascript
// Example component generated by Cursor
const DestinationCard = ({ city, image, description }) => {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
      <img src={image} alt={city} className="w-full h-48 object-cover" />
      <div className="p-6">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">{city}</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">{description}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**2. Content Management**
Advantages of using Markdown:
- Create pages like writing documents
- Version control friendly
- Natural SEO support

```markdown
---
title: "Tokyo Travel Guide"
date: "2024-01-15"
image: "/images/tokyo.jpg"
---

# Complete Tokyo Guide

Tokyo is a city where tradition and modernity blend perfectly...
```

**3. Backend Development (FollowNet Project)**
```python
# Python scraper code generated by Cursor
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class GitHubScraper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.session = requests.Session()
    
    def get_followers(self, username):
        # AI-generated data scraping logic
        url = f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}/followers"
        response = self.session.get(url)
        return response.json()
```

### Step 4: Deployment and Launch

**Automated Deployment Process:**
1. **Cursor → GitHub**: One-click code push
2. **GitHub → Vercel**: Automatic deployment trigger
3. **Domain Binding**: Alibaba Cloud domain $2/year
4. **SSL Certificate**: Vercel automatic configuration

```bash
# Git operations in Cursor
git add .
git commit -m "Initial website launch"
git push origin main
# Vercel automatic deployment complete!
```

## Core Development Techniques

### 1. Efficient AI Conversation Techniques

**Good Question Format:**
```
My website homepage loads slowly, users report poor experience.
Current homepage contains: 10 high-res images, 3 videos, complex animations.
Please help optimize performance with requirements:
- First screen load time under 2 seconds
- Maintain visual effects unchanged
- Provide specific code modification solutions
```

**Poor Question Format:**
```
Website slow, what to do?
```

### 2. Maximizing Real-time Preview

**Development Workflow:**
1. Modify code in Cursor
2. Local real-time preview to check effects
3. Push to GitHub when satisfied
4. Vercel automatic deployment, online preview
5. Return to step 1 if issues found

### 3. Debugging and Problem Solving

**Screenshot + AI Analysis Method:**
- Screenshot errors and send to Claude
- Describe expected vs actual effects
- AI provides precise fix solutions

**Example Conversation:**
```
My website displays incorrectly on mobile (attach screenshot)
Expected: Navigation menu should collapse into hamburger menu
Actual: Navigation menu overflows screen
Please help fix responsive layout issues
```
