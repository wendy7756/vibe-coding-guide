## Phase 1: Requirement Expression & Clarification

### 1.1 Initial Requirement Description

**User Input Example:**
```
I want to create a task management application where users can create, 
edit, and delete tasks. It should also have reminder functionality 
and some data analytics features.
```

**AI Response Strategy:**
AI will clarify requirements through a series of questions:
- Is this a web application or mobile app?
- What's the expected user scale?
- Do you need multi-user collaboration features?
- What specific data analytics are you looking for?
- Are there budget and time constraints?

### 1.2 Requirement Refinement Techniques

**Effective Follow-up Questions:**

1. **Functional Detail Inquiries**
   ```
   "Regarding the reminder functionality you mentioned, do you mean:
   - Browser push notifications?
   - Email reminders?
   - Mobile push notifications?
   - Or other forms?"
   ```

2. **User Experience Inquiries**
   ```
   "For task organization, would you prefer:
   - Project-based categorization?
   - Priority-based sorting?
   - Tag system support?
   - Timeline view?"
   ```

3. **Technical Constraint Inquiries**
   ```
   "Regarding deployment and maintenance:
   - Do you need offline functionality?
   - Should data be stored locally or in the cloud?
   - Any specific browser compatibility requirements?"
   ```
