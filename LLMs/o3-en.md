    """Estimate reasoning cost"""
    base_input_cost = 10.00  # Per million tokens
    base_output_cost = 40.00  # Per million tokens
    
    # Reasoning depth affects cost
    effort_multiplier = {
        "low": 1.0,
        "medium": 1.5,
        "high": 2.0
    }
    
    multiplier = effort_multiplier.get(reasoning_effort, 1.5)
    
    input_cost = (input_tokens / 1_000_000) * base_input_cost
    output_cost = (output_tokens / 1_000_000) * base_output_cost * multiplier
    
    return {
        "input_cost": input_cost,
        "output_cost": output_cost,
        "total_cost": input_cost + output_cost,
